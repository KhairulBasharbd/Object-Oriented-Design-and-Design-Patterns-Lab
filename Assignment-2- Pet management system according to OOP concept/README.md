# Pet Management System

This is a Java program that demonstrates a simple pet management system. It includes the following classes:

- `Pet`: An abstract class representing a pet, with properties like name and age, and an abstract method to make a sound.
- `Dog` and `Cat`: Concrete classes that extend the `Pet` class and implement the `makeSound` method for dogs and cats.
